Each question on the window lets you customize specific things, as follows:<br><br>1. What EAR (Eye Aspect ratio) algorithm value would you like to use? So, this one depends on the lighting conditions and how small/big the eyes are. For me, I usually use 5 for EAR (which is eyes val in the 1st image attached). Try setting a value between 4-7 by typing it in the textbox in the customization window. Then, the mouse control app, on screen keyboard, and voice assistant will open. Check the green text, in the same attached image--when you close your eye, if the value of left/right eye (depending on which eye you close) is not going lower than the set EAR value, then you will have to increase the EAR value by saying "Lyra settings" to open the app's customization window and readjusting the EAR value. For example, if you set the EAR value as 5, then, when you close the eye, the green text should show the value lower than 5, but if it doesn't then set the EAR value as 6, and check the green text again for eye value if it gets lower than 6 when you close your eye.<br><br>2. What MAR (Mouth aspect Ratio) algorithm value would you like to use? So, this one depends on the lighting conditions and how small/big the mouth is. For me, I usually use 19 for MAR (which is mouth val in the 1st image attached). Try setting a value between 15-25 by typing it in the textbox in the customization window. Then, the mouse control app, on screen keyboard, and voice assistant will open. Check the green text, in the image attached; when you open your mouth, if the value of 'Mouth Open' is not going higher than the set MAR value, you will have to decrease the MAR value by saying "Lyra settings" to open the app's customization window and readjusting the MAR value. For example, if you set the MAR value as 19, then, when you open your mouth, the green text should show the 'Mouth Open' value greater than 19, but if it doesn't then set the MAR value as 18, and check the green text again if it gets higher than 18 when you open your mouth.</p><img src="/assets/img/customization_text.png?h=e953f7837a0ee2cf68b0f7f9cea136ad" style="padding-left: 20px;"><p style="padding-left: 20px;padding-top: 20px;">3. Would you like to run the app on start up? This is your personal preference. If you choose 'yes', any time you turn on your computer, the app will start and if you choose 'no', you will have to open the app manually by typing DeviceABLE in the Window's search bar.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 20px;padding-left: 20px;padding-bottom: 20px;">Features</h1><p style="padding-left: 20px;">My app, DeviceABLE, is a novel, free assistive technology (AT) with many features. DeviceABLE is a completely hands-free app that replaces the computer's traditional keyboard and mouse with a virtual keyboard and mouse, to remove human-computer interaction (HCI) barriers for people with disabilities. One can easily download and install my app for free from my website: deviceable.netlify.app. It is an easy to use app. DeviceABLE is wireless, and also works with just built-in webcam or cellphone camera and so does not require any additional/external hardware, so its setup is very quick and easy. With no additional hardware, my app is very convenient and comfortable to use even for prolonged time, whereas most other devices require bulky hardware such as the head gears, sip and puffs, or the hardware that gives discomfort, such as mouth, head or chin operated joysticks, or the switches that are operated with different body parts. Some hands-free devices are as much as $3,000, but my app is completely free and also provides free technical support. DeviceABLE is a novel app because unlike most others products, it provides both the input peripherals – virtual mouse as well as a virtual keyboard, for the complete computing experience: reading and writing documents, emails, online search, YouTube or any other apps, social media, video games, drawing, music, and so on – you can do everything. And also, you can type in your main window directly, instead of first typing in the app window and then copy-pasting it in the main window. Moreover, DeviceABLE also provides many customizable features such as, adjusting EAR/MAR values, keyboard size, choosing if you want to open app on computer startup or not, and choosing which voice recognition model you want to use. These customizable features are especially important for people with disabilities because each person’s impairment, severity and needs are different.&nbsp;</p><h1 style="padding-top: 20px;padding-left: 20px;padding-bottom: 20px;">Functions</h1><p style="padding-left: 20px;">DeviceABLE provides both, the virtual mouse as well as keyboard, completely hands-free. People with disabilities have different needs and impairments, so the DeviceABLE provides two hands-free choices/options: by panning your head and opening/closing eyes and mouth (if they can do these gestures, but can’t speak clearly) and/or by speaking (if they can speak clearly, but can’t do facial/head gestures). Lyra, voice assistant, can perform all the following functions except the mouse cursor.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Mouse</strong><br>Cursor: Pan your head in any direction you want to move the cursor to, and the cursor will move accordingly.<br>Left click: by closing your left eye for 2 seconds. Or by saying “Lyra left click”.<br>Right click: by closing your right eye for 2 seconds. Or by saying “Lyra right click”.<br>Dragging/scrolling: by opening your mouth for 2 seconds to activate dragging/scrolling, then close your mouth while it is dragging/scrolling, and then opening it again to deactivate dragging/scrolling. Or you can also say “Lyra start dragging” and “Lyra stop dragging”.<br><br><strong>On-screen Keyboard</strong><br>Hover on for just 2 seconds on the key you want to type and then that key will be typed, but if you hover on the key for too long then it will keep typing that key and then you have to hover on the backspace key to delete it. Or you can also do voice typing using Lyra.<br><br><strong>Lyra (Voice Assistant)</strong><br>Say any Lyra command (eg. left/right clicks, enter, backspace, typing, dragging/scrolling etc), and based on the command, the DeviceABLE app will perform that action. When using Lyra type, don't say the sentence slowly with pauses, but say it normally, so Lyra will be more accurate. Also, Lyra is to complement the virtual mouse and the online-keyboard; and is made for people that aren’t able to do facial/head gestures, so they can use their voice instead, for clicking and typing.</p><!-- Start: Footer Dark --><footer class="text-center bg-dark"><div class="container text-white py-4 py-lg-5"><p class="text-muted mb-0">Copyright © 2024 DeviceABLE</p></div></footer><!-- End: Footer Dark --><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/script.min.js?h=8d021084d0eaed5f081872650dbb993f"></script></body></html>
